RRPC: REST Reverse Polish Calculator
====

This is a pet project to build a reverse polish calculator that offers a pure REST API.

If you are familiar with REST, you have probably notice to some extent that most of the self-claimed
REST APIs out there are

* either not REST at all (at best, as Roy Fielding himself calls them, they are REST-RPC hybrids)
* storage services

for research purposes, I am interested in testing REST APIs, and I would like to see alternative
examples that do not fall in either of the categories above. Thus, if you know of any examples,
please point me to them!
